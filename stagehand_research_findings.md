# Stagehand Python Library Research Findings

## Executive Summary

Stagehand is a cutting-edge AI-powered browser automation framework built by Browserbase that bridges the gap between traditional brittle automation tools (Playwright, Selenium) and unpredictable fully agentic solutions (OpenAI Operator). **The good news is that a comprehensive StagehandTool for crewAI already exists and is fully functional** in the current repository.

## What is Stagehand?

### Overview
Stagehand is an AI browser automation framework that allows developers to control web browsers using natural language instructions. It's designed to be:
- **Repeatable**: Code that can be executed the same way every time
- **Resilient**: Handles unpredictable DOM changes automatically  
- **Controllable**: Developers maintain granular control over automation workflows

### Key Features

#### 1. **Atomic Primitives**
Stagehand provides three core primitives for precise browser control:

- **`act()`**: Perform actions like clicking buttons, filling forms, scrolling
- **`extract()`**: Extract structured data from web pages using AI
- **`observe()`**: Identify and analyze elements on a page

#### 2. **Dynamic Agent**
For complex workflows, Stagehand includes an agent that can:
- Break down high-level instructions into atomic actions
- Cache action previews to reduce LLM calls
- Self-heal when cached actions fail

#### 3. **Hybrid Approach**
Unlike purely agentic solutions, Stagehand allows mixing:
- Atomic instructions for precise control
- AI agents for complex decision-making
- Standard Playwright commands for complete control

## Technical Capabilities

### Browser Automation Features
- **Cross-browser support**: Works on any Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Edge, Arc, Brave, etc.)
- **Natural language control**: "Click the login button", "Extract all product prices"
- **Iframe support**: Advanced iframe handling for complex web applications
- **Chrome Accessibility Tree**: Uses accessibility tree for cleaner, more reliable DOM parsing
- **Self-healing**: Automatically adapts to minor UI changes

### AI Integration
- **Multiple LLM support**: OpenAI GPT-4o, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini
- **Model-specific optimization**: Different models excel at different tasks
- **Smart model selection**: Automatically chooses best model for each operation
- **Action caching**: Reduces LLM calls by caching successful actions

### Advanced Features
- **Session persistence**: Sessions can be paused, resumed, and shared
- **Screenshot capabilities**: Automatic screenshots for debugging
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error recovery and reporting
- **Performance optimization**: Optimized for speed and reliability

## Current Implementation Status

### File Structure
```
crewai_tools/tools/stagehand_tool/
â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py          # Tool export
â”œâ”€â”€ stagehand_tool.py    # Main implementation (602 lines)
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md           # Comprehensive documentation (273 lines)
â””â”€â”€ example.py          # Usage examples (117 lines)
```

## Key Implementation Features

### 1. **Command Types**
The StagehandTool supports four operation modes:

- **`act`** (default): Perform interactions like clicking, typing, scrolling
- **`navigate`**: Navigate to specific URLs
- **`extract`**: Pull structured data from pages using natural language
- **`observe`**: Identify and analyze page elements

### 2. **Configuration Options**
Extensive configuration support including:
- Browserbase API integration
- Multiple LLM model support (Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini)
- Performance tuning (timeouts, healing, verbosity)
- Browser settings (headless mode, screenshot options)

### 3. **Error Handling & Testing**
- Comprehensive error handling with meaningful messages
- Built-in testing mode for development
- Context manager for automatic resource cleanup
- Detailed logging and debugging support

### 4. **Usage Patterns**
Two supported usage patterns:
```python
# Context manager (recommended)
with StagehandTool(...) as tool:
    agent = Agent(tools=[tool])
    
# Manual resource management
tool = StagehandTool(...)
try:
    agent = Agent(tools=[tool])
finally:
    tool.close()
```

## Testing Results

I created and ran comprehensive tests that verify:
- âœ… Tool initialization and configuration
- âœ… All four command types (act, navigate, extract, observe)
- âœ… Context manager functionality
- âœ… CrewAI agent integration
